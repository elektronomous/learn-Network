= Since these transmission methods differ based on how many and which devices receive the transmission, 
  they are tied directly to the methods used for addressing, as follows:
  = Unicast Addressing Unicast delivery requires that a message should be addressed to a specific recipient. 
    This is the most common type of messaging, so this addressing capability is present in almost all protocols
  = Broadcast Addressing Broadcasts are normally implemented via a special address that is reserved for that 
    function. Whenever devices see a message sent to that address, they all interpret it as “This message goes to everyone.”
  = Multicast Addressing Multicasts are the most complex type of message because they require a means of identifying a 
    set of specific devices that will receive a message. It is often necessary to create several such groups, which may or may not partially
    overlap in their membership. Some mechanism is needed to manage which devices are in which groups
= Three basic methods are used to address and transmit data between networked devices. A unicast transmission goes from
  one device to exactly one other; this is the most common method used for most message transactions. 
= A broadcast transmission is sent from one device to all connected devices on a network. 
= A multicast transmission is addressed and sent to a select group of devices
= one special case in the field of addressing is worth mentioning. In some networks or links, only two devices are 
  connected together, forming what is often called a point-to-point network
