= Protocols define a language and a set of rules and procedures that enable devices and systems to communicate
= Networking protocols concern themselves with ensuring that all the
  devices on a network or internetwork are in agreement about how various actions
  must be performed in the total communication process
= In the context of the OSI Reference Model, a protocol is formally defined as a set of rules governing communication 
  between entities at the same layer
  = For example, each host on a TCP/IP network has a TCP implementation, and those hosts all communicate with each other logically
    at layer 4 of the OSI model.
= One fundamental way to differentiate between networking technologies is on the basis of the method used to determine the path 
  between devices over which information will flow
  = In the circuit-switching networking method, a connection called a circuit, which is used for the whole communication, is set up 
    between two devices
    = Even if many potential paths through intermediate devices may exist between the two devices that are communicating, only one 
      will be used for any given dialogue (02_Notes_1.jpg)
    = The classic example of a circuit-switched network is the telephone system.
      = When you call someone and she answers, you establish a circuit connection and can pass data in a steady stream
      = That circuit functions the same way, regardless of how many intermediate devices are used to carry your voice
  = In the packet-switching network type, no specific path is used for data transfer Instead, the data is chopped up into small pieces called 
    packets and sent over the network.
  = You can route, combine, or fragment the packets as required to get them to their eventual destination
  = On the receiving end, the process is reversed—the data is read from the packets and reassembled to form the original data (02_Notes_2.JPG)
= One important issue in selecting a switching method is whether the network medium is shared or dedicated
  = Your phone line can be used for establishing a circuit because you are the only one who can use it (dedicated)
  = this doesn’t work well with LANs, which typically use a single shared medium and baseband signaling
    = If two devices were to establish a connection, they would lock out all the other devices for a
      long period of time
      = It makes more sense to chop the data into small pieces and send them one at a time. Then, if two other devices want to communicate, 
        their packets can be interspersed, and everyone can share the network
    = there are some disadvantages of packet switching compared to circuit switching, all data does not take the same predictable path between 
      devices, it is possible that some pieces of data may get lost in transit or show up in the incorrect order
= in modern networks, packet and circuit are often combined 
  = For example, suppose you connect to the Internet using a dial-up modem. You will be using IP datagrams (packets) to carry higher-layer data, 
    but it will be over the circuit-switched telephone network. Yet the data may be sent over the telephone system in digital packetized form.
= Another issue is the relationship between circuit and packet switching, and whether a technology is connection-oriented or connectionless
= Protocols are divided into the following two categories based on their use of connections :
  = Connection-Oriented Protocols These protocols require you to establish a logical connection between two devices before transferring data.
    = This is generally accomplished by following a specific set of rules that specify how a connection should be initiated, negotiated, managed, 
      and eventually terminated
    = one device begins by sending a request to open a connection, and the other responds. The devices pass control information to determine if and 
      how the connection should be set up
  = Connectionless Protocols These protocols do not establish a connection between devices. As soon as a device has data to send to another, 
    it just sends it
