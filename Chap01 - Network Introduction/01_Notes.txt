= A network is simply a collection of computers or other hardware devices that are connected
  together, either physically or logically, using special hardware and software
  that allows the devices to exchange information and cooperate
= Networking is the term that describes the processes involved in designing, implementing, upgrading,
  managing, and otherwise working with networks and network technologies
= Most of the benefits of networking can be divided into two basic categories:
  connectivity and sharing
= At a high level, networks are advantageous because they allow computers
  and people to be connected together so that they can share resources. Some of the specific
  benefits of networking include communication, data sharing, Internet access, data security and
  management, application performance enhancement, and entertainment
= Networking has a few drawbacks that you can weigh against its many
  positive aspects. Setting up a network has costs in hardware, software, maintenance, and
  administration. It is also necessary to manage a network to keep it running smoothly and to
  address possible misuse or abuse issues. Data security also becomes a much bigger concern
  when computers are connected together
= Networking technologies are most often compartmentalized(terkotak - kotak) in this manner by
  dividing their functions into layers, each of which contains hardware and software
  lements
  = Each layer is responsible for performing a particular type of task and
    interacts with the layers above and below it
  = Layers are conceptually arranged into a vertical stack
  = Lower layers are charged with more concrete tasks such as hardware
    signaling and low-level communication; they provide services to the higher layers
  = The higher layers, in turn, use these services to implement more abstract functions
    such as implementing user applications
= One other important benefit of layering is that makes it possible for technologies
  defined by different groups to interoperate
  = For this to be possible, it is necessary for everyone to agree on how layers will be 
    defined and used. The most common tool for this purpose is a networking model
  = The model describes what the different layers are in the network, what each is responsible 
    for doing, and how they interact
  = The most common general model in use today is the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model, 
    which consists of seven stacked layers
  = These range from the physical layer (layer 1) at the bottom, which is responsible for lowlevel
    signaling
  = to the application layer (layer 7) at the top, where application software is implemented. 
= An architecture is essentially a set of rules that describes the function of some portion
  of the hardware and software that constitutes a stack of layers
  = Such a ruleset usually takes the form of a specification or standard that describes how equipment and
    programs using the technology must behave
  = A networking architecture is designed to implement the functions associated with a particular contiguous 
    set of layers of the OSI Reference Model, either formally or informally
