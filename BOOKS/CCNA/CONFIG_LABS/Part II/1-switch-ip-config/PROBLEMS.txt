For this lab, you should configure the IP settings for the two LAN switches. You need to decide what IP 
settings need to be configured and then plan the specific configuration commands. The list of requirements
includes the subnet ID to use. Specifically:

    1. Both switches use VLAN 1 as the management VLAN.
    2. Use subnet 192.168.1.0/27.
    3. Use the numerically highest IP addresses: the highest for the router’s G0/0 interface into the LAN,
       the next highest for SW1’s management address, and the next highest for SW2’s management address. 
       Note that R1’s IP address has been pre-configured for the purposes of this lab.
    4. Configure SW1 and SW2 to allow communication off-subnet as well as on-subnet.
    5. Neither switch uses VLAN trunking, and all ports are in the default VLAN (1).
