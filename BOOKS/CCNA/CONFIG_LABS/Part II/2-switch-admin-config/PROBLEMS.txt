For this lab, you need to configure passwords, plus a few other administrative settings. Note 
that this lab does not ask you to configure IP addressing, leaving that to other labs. However,
this lab does ask you to configure the rest of the settings to prepare to allow for inbound
Telnet and SSH into the switches.

The requirements are as follows.

    1. On both switches, protect the console using the password “fred”.
    2. On switch SW1, allow telnet but not SSH into the switch, with simple password protection 
       without using a username. Use password “sw1”.
    3. On switch SW2, allow both telnet and SSH into the switch, with both a username and password.
       You can choose the actual username and password.
    4. On both SW1 and SW2, do not yet configure IP details; defer that work until the router folks
       tell you what IP addresses to use.
    5. Give each switch a hostname to match the figure.
    6. For each interface used in the lab, document the device’s name on the other end of the link
       connected to the interface. For instance, for SW1, port G1/0/1, document that “PC1” is on the
       other end of the link.
    7. On switch SW1, protect privileged mode using the older style (and easier to break) password.
       Make this password “sw1bad”.
    8. On switch SW2, protect privileged mode using the newer style (and more secure) password that
       uses MD5 encoding. Make this password “sw2good”.
