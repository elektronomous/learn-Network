However, to understand IP routing, you need to understand the basics of the two types of WAN
links introduced in the first major section of this chapter: serial links and Ethernet WAN
links. In their most basic form, these WAN links connect routers that sit at sites that can
be miles to hundreds of miles apart, allowing communications between remote sites.

WIDE-AREA NETWORKS
Imagine a typical day at the branch office at some enterprise. The user sits at some endpoint
device: a PC, tablet, phone, and so on. It connects to a LAN, either via an Ethernet cable or
using a wireless LAN. However, the user happens to be checking information on a website, and
that web server sits at the home office of the company. To make that work, the data travels
over one or more wide-area network (WAN) links.

WAN technologies define the physical (Layer 1) standards and data-link (Layer 2) protocols
used to communicate long distances. This first section examines two such technologies:
leased-line WANs and Ethernet WANs. 

LEASED-LINE WANs
To connect LANs using a WAN, the internetwork uses a router connected to each LAN, with a WAN 
link between the routers. First, the enterprise’s network engineer would order some kind of WAN
link. A router at each site connects to both the WAN link and the LAN, as shown in Image1.PNG.
Note that a crooked line between the routers is the common way to represent a leased line when
the drawing does not need to show any of the physical details of the line.

PHYSICAL DETAILS OF LEASED LINES
The leased line service delivers bits in both directions, at a predetermined speed, using fullduplex
logic. In fact, conceptually it acts as if you had a full-duplex crossover Ethernet link between two
routers, as shown in Image2.PNG. The leased line uses two pairs of wires, one pair for each direction
of sending data, which allows full-duplex operation.

To create such possibly long links, or circuits, a leased line does not actually exist as a single long
cable between the two sites. Instead, the telephone company (telco) that creates the leased line 
installs a large network of cables and specialized switching devices to create its own computer network.
The telco network creates a service that acts like a crossover cable between two points, but the physical
reality is hidden from the customer.

the term leased line refers to the fact that the company using the leased line does not own the line but
instead pays a monthly lease fee to use it. Table 3-2 lists some of the many names for leased lines, mainly
so that in a networking job, you have a chance to translate from the terms each person uses with a basic
description as to the meaning of the name.

    Name                        Meaning or Reference
―――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――
Leased circuit,             The words line and circuit are often used as synonyms in telco terminology;
Circuit                     circuit makes reference to the electrical circuit between the two endpoints.

Serial link,                The words link and line are also often used as synonyms. Serial in this case
Serial line                 refers to the fact that the bits flow serially and that routers use serial interfaces.

Point-to-point              These terms refer to the fact that the topology stretches between two
link, Point-to-point line   points, and two points only. (Some older leased lines allowed more than two devices.)

T1                          This specific type of leased line transmits data at 1.544 megabits per second (1.544 Mbps).

WAN link, Link              Both of these terms are very general, with no reference to any specific technology.

Private line                This term refers to the fact that the data sent over the line cannot be copied by other telco
                            customers, so the data is private.

Image3.PNG gives a little insight into the cabling that could exist inside the telco for a short leased line.
Telcos put their equipment in buildings called central offices (CO). The telco installs cables from the CO to
most every other building in the city, expecting to sell services to the people in those buildings one day. 
The telco would then configure its switches to use some of the capacity on each cable to send data in both 
directions, creating the equivalent of a crossover cable between the two routers.

HDLC DATA-LINNK DETAILS OF LEASED-LINES
A leased line provides a Layer 1 service. In other words, it promises to deliver bits between the devices connected
to the leased line. However, the leased line itself does not define a data-link layer protocol to be used on the
leased line.

Because leased lines define only the Layer 1 transmission service, many companies and standards organizations have 
created data-link protocols to control and use leased lines. Today, the two most popular data-link layer protocols
used for leased lines between two routers are High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) and Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP).

HDLC has less work to do than Ethernet because of the simple point-to-point topology of a leased line. When one router
sends an HDLC frame, the frame can go only one place: to the other end of the link. So, while HDLC has an address 
field, the destination is implied, and the actual address is unimportant. All data-link protocols perform a similar 
role: to control the correct delivery of data over a physical link of a particular type. For example, the Ethernet data
-link protocol uses a destination address field to identify the correct device that should receive the data and an FCS
field that allows the receiving device to determine whether the data arrived correctly. HDLC provides similar functions.

        Field               Equivalent

        Flag                Preamble,       Lists a recognizable bit pattern so that the receiving nodes realize that
                            SFD             a new frame is arriving.
        Address             Destination     Identifies the destination device.

                                            routers.
        Type                Type            Identifies the type of Layer 3 packet encapsulated inside the frame.
        FCS                 FCS             Identifies a field used by the error detection process. (It is the only
                                            trailer field in this table.)

HDLC exists today as a standard of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the same organization that
brought us the OSI model. However, ISO standard HDLC does not have a Type field, and routers need to know the type of
packet inside the frame. So, Cisco routers use a Cisco-proprietary variation of HDLC that adds a Type field, as shown in
Image4.PNG.
