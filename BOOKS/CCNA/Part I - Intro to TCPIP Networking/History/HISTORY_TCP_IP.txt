Today, the world of computer networking uses one networking model: TCP/IP. However, the world has
not always been so simple. Once upon a time, networking protocols didn’t exist, including TCP/IP.
Vendors created the first networking protocols; these protocols supported only that vendor’s computers.
For example, IBM, the computer company with the largest market share in many markets back in the 1970s
and 1980s, published its Systems Network Architecture (SNA) networking model in 1974. Other vendors also
created their own proprietary(hak cipta) networking models. As a result, if your company bought computers from three
vendors, network engineers often had to create three different networks based on the networking models
created by each company, and then somehow connect those networks, making the combined networks much more
complex. The left side of Image1.PNG shows the general idea of what a company’s enterprise network might 
have looked like back in the 1980s, before TCP/IP became common in enterprise internetworks.

Although vendor-defined proprietary networking models often worked well, having an open, vendor-neutral networking model
would aid competition and reduce complexity. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) took on the task to
create such a model, starting as early as the late 1970s, beginning work on what would become known as the Open Systems
Interconnection (OSI) networking model. ISO had a noble goal for the OSI model: to standardize data networking protocols
to allow communication among all computers across the entire planet. ISO worked toward this ambitious and noble goal, with
participants from most of the technologically developed nations on Earth participating in the process. A second, less-formal
effort to create an open, vendor-neutral, public networking model sprouted forth from a U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)
contract. Researchers at various universities volunteered to help further develop the protocols surrounding the original DoD
work. These efforts resulted in a competing open networking model called TCP/IP. During the 1990s, companies began adding OSI,
TCP/IP, or both to their enterprise networks. However, by the end of the 1990s, TCP/IP had become the common choice, and OSI fell
away. The center part of Image1.PNG shows the general idea behind enterprise networks in that decade—still with networks built
upon multiple networking models but including TCP/IP. Here in the twenty-first century, TCP/IP dominates. Proprietary networking
models still exist, but they have mostly been discarded in favor of TCP/IP. The OSI model, whose development suffered in part
because of a slower formal standardization process as compared with TCP/IP, never succeeded in the marketplace. And TCP/IP, the
networking model originally created almost entirely by a bunch of volunteers, has become the most prolific network model ever, as
shown on the right side of Image1.PNG. In this chapter, you will read about some of the basics of TCP/IP. Although you will learn
some interesting facts about TCP/IP, the true goal of this chapter is to help you understand what a networking model or networking
architecture really is and how it works. Also in this chapter, you will learn about some of the jargon used with OSI. Will any of you
ever work on a computer that is using the full OSI protocols instead of TCP/IP? Probably not. However, you will often use terms 
relating to OSI.
