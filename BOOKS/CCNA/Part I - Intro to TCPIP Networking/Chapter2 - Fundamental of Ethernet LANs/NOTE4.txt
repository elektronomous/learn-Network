SENDING DATA IN ETHERNET NETWORKS
Although physical layer standards vary quite a bit, other parts of the Ethernet standards work
the same regardless of the type of physical Ethernet link. 

ETHERNET DATA-LINK PROTOCOLS
The Ethernet data-link protocol defines the Ethernet frame: an Ethernet header at the front, the
encapsulated data in the middle, and an Ethernet trailer at the end. Ethernet actually defines a
few alternate formats for the header, with the frame format shown in Image26.PNG being commonly
used today.

Table 2-6 IEEE 802.3 Ethernet Header and Trailer Fields
        Field           Bytes       Description
        ―――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――
        Preamble        7           Synchronization.

        Start Frame     1           Signifies that the next byte begins the Destination MAC
        Delimiter (SFD)             Address field.

        Destination     6           Identifies the intended recipient of this frame.
        MAC Address

        Source MAC      6           Identifies the sender of this frame.
        Address

        Type            2           Defines the type of protocol listed inside the frame; today,
                                    most likely identifies IP version 4 (IPv4) or IP version 6 (IPv6).

        Data and Pad*   46–1500     Holds data from a higher layer, typically an L3PDU (usually
                                    an IPv4 or IPv6 packet). The sender adds padding to meet the minimum length 
                                    requirement for this field (46 bytes).

        Frame Check     4           Provides a method for the receiving NIC to determine whether
        Sequence (FCS)              the frame experienced transmission errors.

*preamble = pembukaan
* The IEEE 802.3 specification limits the data portion of the 802.3 frame to a minimum of 46 and a
maximum of 1500 bytes. The term maximum transmission unit (MTU) defines the maximum Layer 3 packet
that can be sent over a medium. Because the Layer 3 packet rests inside the data portion of an 
Ethernet frame, 1500 bytes is the largest IP MTU allowed over an Ethernet.

ETHERNET ADDRESSING
Ethernet addresses, also called Media Access Control (MAC) addresses, are 6-byte-long (48-bit-long)
binary numbers. For convenience, most computers list MAC addresses as 12-digit hexadecimal numbers.
Cisco devices typically add some periods to the number for easier readability as well; for example,
a Cisco switch might list a MAC address as 0000.0C12.3456.

Most MAC addresses represent a single NIC or other Ethernet port, so these addresses are often 
called a unicast Ethernet address. The term unicast is simply a formal way to refer to the fact that
the address represents one interface to the Ethernet LAN. (This term also contrasts with two other
types of Ethernet addresses, broadcast and multicast, which will be defined later in this section.)

If two NICs tried to use the same MAC address, there could be confusion. (The problem would be like
the confusion caused to the postal service if you and I both tried to use the same mailing address—
would the postal service deliver mail to your house or mine?) If two PCs on the same Ethernet tried
to use the same MAC address, to which PC should frames sent to that MAC address be delivered?

Ethernet solves this problem using an administrative process so that, at the time of manufacture, 
all Ethernet devices are assigned a universally unique MAC address. Before a manufacturer can build
Ethernet products, it must ask the IEEE to assign the manufacturer a universally unique 3-byte code,
called the organizationally unique identifier (OUI). The manufacturer agrees to give all NICs (and
other Ethernet products) a MAC address that begins with its assigned 3-byte OUI. The manufacturer
also assigns a unique value for the last 3 bytes, a number that manufacturer has never used with that
OUI. As a result, the MAC address of every device in the universe is unique. (Image27.PNG)

             ASSIGNED BY MANUFACTURES
             |------|
    AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
    |------|
    IEEE OUI

NOTE: The IEEE also calls these universal MAC addresses global MAC addresses.

Ethernet addresses go by many names: LAN address, Ethernet address, hardware address, burned-in 
address, physical address, universal address, or MAC address. For example, the term burned-in address
(BIA) refers to the idea that a permanent MAC address has been encoded (burned into) the ROM chip on 
the NIC. As another example, the IEEE uses the term universal address to emphasize the fact that the
address assigned to a NIC by a manufacturer should be unique among all MAC addresses in the universe.

In addition to unicast addresses, Ethernet also uses group addresses. Group addresses identify more 
than one LAN interface card. A frame sent to a group address might be delivered to a small set of 
devices on the LAN, or even to all devices on the LAN. In fact, the IEEE defines two general categories
of group addresses for Ethernet: 

    Broadcast address: Frames sent to this address should be delivered to all devices on the Ethernet LAN.
                       It has a value of FFFF.FFFF.FFFF.
    Multicast addresses: Frames sent to a multicast Ethernet address will be copied and forwarded to a 
                         subset of the devices on the LAN that volunteers to receive frames sent to a
                         specific multicast address.

MAC                             Media Access Control. 802.3 (Ethernet) defines the MAC sublayer of
                                IEEE Ethernet.

Ethernet address, NIC           Other names often used instead of MAC address. These terms
address, LAN address            describe the 6-byte address of the LAN interface card.

Burned-in address               The 6-byte address assigned by the vendor making the card.
Unicast address                 A term for a MAC address that represents a single LAN interface.
Broadcast address               An address that means “all devices that reside on this LAN right now.”
Multicast address               On Ethernet, a multicast address implies some subset of all devices
                                currently on the Ethernet LAN.
