MISMATCHED NATIVE VLAN ON A TRUNK
Unfortunately, it is possible to set the native VLAN ID to different VLANs on either end of the trunk, using the
"switchport trunk native vlan vlan-id" command. If the native VLANs differ according to the two neighboring switches,
the switches will cause frames sent in the native VLAN to jump from one VLAN to the other.

For example, if switch SW1 sends a frame using native VLAN 1 on an 802.1Q trunk, SW1 does not add a VLAN header, as is
normal for the native VLAN. When switch SW2 receives the frame, noticing that no 802.1Q header exists, SW2 assumes that
the frame is part of SW2â€™s configured native VLAN. If SW2 has been configured to think VLAN 2 is the native VLAN on that
trunk, SW2 will try to forward the received frame into VLAN 2. (This effect of a frame being sent in one VLAN but then
being believed to be in a different VLAN is called VLAN hopping.)
