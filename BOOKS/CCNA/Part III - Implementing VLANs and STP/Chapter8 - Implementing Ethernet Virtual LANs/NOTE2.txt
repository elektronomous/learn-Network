THE 802.1Q and ISL VLAN TRUNKING PROTOCOLS
Cisco has supported two different trunking protocols over the years: Inter-Switch Link (ISL) and IEEE
802.1Q. Cisco created the ISL years before 802.1Q, in part because the IEEE had not yet defined a VLAN
trunking standard. Today, 802.1Q has become the more popular trunking protocol, with Cisco not even 
bothering to support ISL in many of its switch models today.
