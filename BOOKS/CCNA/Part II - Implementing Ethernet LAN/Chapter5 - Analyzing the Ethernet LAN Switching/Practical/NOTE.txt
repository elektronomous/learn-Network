DEMONSTRATING MAC LEARNING
= Open your packet tracer and open the Configuration1.pkt
= Set each PC to use all of this MAC ADDRESS:
  0200.1111.1111 = PC0
  0200.2222.2222 = PC1
  0200.3333.3333 = PC2
  0200.4444.4444 = PC3
= Set each PC to use all of this IP ADDRESS:
  10.10.1.2 with subnet mask 255.255.255.0 = PC0
  10.10.1.3 with subnet mask 255.255.255.0 = PC1
  10.10.1.4 with subnet mask 255.255.255.0 = PC2
  10.10.1.5 with subnet mask 255.255.255.0 = PC3
  
= Setting the switch to:
    ■ Use the erase startup-config EXEC command to erase the startup-config file
    ■ Use the delete vlan.dat EXEC command to delete the VLAN configuration details
    ■ Use the reload EXEC command to reload the switch (thereby using the empty startupconfig, with no VLAN information configured)
    ■ Configure the hostname SW1 command to set the switch hostname

= Now try to ping from one pc to another, and then each time you ping using the command "show mac-address-table" to see CAM of the
  switch (also you can use the command "show mac-address-table dynamic")

Next, look at the Type field in the heading of the output table. The column tells us how the switch learned the MAC
address as described earlier in this chapter; in this case, the switch learned all MAC addresses dynamically. You
can also statically predefine MAC table entries using a couple of different features, including port security, and
those would appear as Static in the Type column.

Finally, the VLAN column of the output gives us a chance to briefly discuss how VLANs impact switching logic. LAN switches forward
Ethernet frames inside a VLAN. What that means is if a frame enters via a port in VLAN 1, then the switch will forward or flood that
frame out other ports in VLAN 1 only, and not out any ports that happen to be assigned to another VLAN. Chapter 8, “Implementing
Ethernet Virtual LANs,” looks at all the details of how switches forward frames when using VLANs.

= now on your switch, use command "show interfaces status" (for fast typing command "sh int st")

As a reminder, Cisco Catalyst switches name their ports based on the fastest specification supported, so in this case, the switch
has 24 interfaces named FastEthernet, and two named GigabitEthernet. Many commands abbreviate those terms, this time as Fa for
FastEthernet and Gi for GigabitEthernet. (The example happens to come from a Cisco Catalyst switch that has 24 10/100 ports and two
10/100/1000 ports.)

The Status column, of course, tells us the status or state of the port. In this case, the lab switch had cables and devices connected
to ports F0/1–F0/4 only, with no other cables connected. As a result, those first four ports have a state of connected, meaning that
the ports have a cable and are functional. The notconnect state means that the port is not yet functioning. It may mean that there is
no cable installed, but other problems may exist as well. (The section “Analyzing Switch Interface Status and Statistics,” in Chapter
7, “Configuring and Verifying Switch Interfaces,” works through the details of what causes a switch interface to fail.)

NOTE You can see the status for a single interface in a couple of ways. For instance, for F0/1, the command "show interfaces f0/1 
status" lists the status in a single line of output as in your switch lab. The "show interfaces f0/1" command (without the status keyword)
displays a detailed set of messages about the interface.
