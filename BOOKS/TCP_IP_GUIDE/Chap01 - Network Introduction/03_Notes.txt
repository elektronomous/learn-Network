= in order to establish a circuit between two devices, you must connect them.
  = For this reason, circuit-switched networks are inherently based on connections
  = This has led to the interchangeable use of the terms circuit-switched and connection-oriented
= Circuit-switched networking technologies are inherently connection-oriented, but not all connection-oriented 
  technologies use circuit switching. 
= Logical connection-oriented protocols can be implemented on top of packet-switching networks to provide 
  higher-layer services to applications that require connections.
= These connection-oriented protocols are important because they enable the implementation of applications 
  that require connections over packet-switched networks that have no inherent sense of a connection
  = For example, to use the TCP/IP File Transfer Protocol (FTP), you want to be able to connect to a server,
    enter a login and password, and then execute commands to change directories, send or retrieve files, and so on
    = This requires the establishment of a connection over which commands, replies, and data can be passed, this work 
      (indirectly) over IP, which is based on the use of packets
= Even though packets may be used at lower layers for the mechanics of sending data, a higher-layer protocol can create 
  logical connections through the use of messages sent in those packets
= TCP/IP has two main protocols that operate at the transport layer of the OSI Reference Model
  = One is TCP, which is connection-oriented; 
  = the other, the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), is connectionless
= TCP is used for applications that require the establishment of connections (as well as TCP’s other service features),
  = such as FTP
= UDP is used by other applications that don’t need connections or other features, but do need the faster performance
  that UDP can offer by not needing to make such connections before sending data
= Even though you can use a TCP connection to send data back and forth between devices, all that data is indeed still
  being sent as packets; there is no real circuit between the devices
  = This means that TCP must deal with all the potential pitfalls of packet-switched communication, such as the potential 
    for data loss or receipt of data pieces in the incorrect order
= One way that networking technologies are categorized is based on the path used to carry data between devices. In circuit 
  switching, a circuit is first established and then used to carry all data between devices. In packet switching, no fixed path 
  is created between devices that communicate; it is broken into packets, each of which may take a separate path from sender to recipient
= Just as a connection-oriented protocol can be implemented over an inherently connectionless protocol, 
= the reverse is also true: a connectionless protocol can be implemented over a connection-oriented protocol at a lower level
